# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-USING-LOGISTIC-REGRESSION

This sentiment analysis project is a significant milestone in my journey as a Python enthusiast, following a comprehensive course. It showcases my practical skills in natural language processing and machine learning.

Dataset Details:

Training Dataset (train.csv): This dataset serves as the foundation for training our sentiment analysis model. It contains a collection of text samples, where each sample is labeled with its corresponding sentiment. The sentiments are categorized into classes like 'positive,' 'negative,' or 'neutral.'

Testing Dataset (test.csv): This dataset is utilized to assess the performance of our trained model. It shares a similar structure with the training data but lacks sentiment labels. The goal is to predict sentiments for these unlabeled samples.

Additional Testing Dataset (testnew.csv): This dataset is identical to the testing dataset (test.csv) but with sentiments removed. It is used to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy. By applying our trained model to this dataset, we can assess its ability to predict sentiments correctly.

Project Highlights:

Text Preprocessing: The project begins with thorough text preprocessing. This includes cleaning the text, removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, tokenization, eliminating stop words, and applying stemming to reduce words to their base form.

Model Building: The core of the project involves building a sentiment analysis model. We employ logistic regression, a commonly used algorithm for text classification. The model learns to identify sentiment patterns in the text data.

Model Evaluation: To assess our model's performance, we evaluate it using multiple metrics, including F1-score, recall, support, and precision. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's effectiveness.

Hyperparameter Tuning: In pursuit of improving model performance, we explore hyperparameter tuning using grid search. This process aims to identify the optimal hyperparameters that enhance our model's predictive accuracy.

This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in Python but also underscores my dedication to exploring and implementing advanced techniques in natural language processing. It represents the foundation for more ambitious projects and further learning in the field of data science and machine learning.
